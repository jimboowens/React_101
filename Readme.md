Intro to React, introduction to the history of ECMAScript and how it developed:
JavaScript Wars
    1. Pre-ES5
        -1995 (Mocha --> JavaScript)
        -1997 (ES)
        -1998 - ES2
        -1999 - ES3 (minimum baseline)
        -2000 - ES4 starts... but then there's the whole Microsoft thing (steamrolled)
        -2004 ES4 is abandoned. Adobe tries, Yahoo defects, Microsoft continues
        -2005 - AJAX arrives (not used for a few years)
        -2006 - jQuery arrives and hardware starts gaining
        -2008-2009 MS and Yahoo finally come to their senses and ES5 is standardized (modern JS)
    2.The ES5, jQuery, and AJAX webstorm - and smartphones
    3.Framework Invasion (think 13th C. Scotland or Game of Thrones/post-Rome Europe)
    4.Facebook emerges with a state solution: React
    5.What the heck is "state?"
    6.The virtual DOM (we'll get to this...)
    7.React emerges as champion aparent... for now.
    8.The war is now internal, instead of external
    9.Angular 2-7 is the other big dog.
    10.Ember, Vue, etc. probably won't make empire status, but a strong, modern city state (like Monaco and Singapore)
    11.React licensing and Apache - Apache blacklisted Facebook and facebook knelt
